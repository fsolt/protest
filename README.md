# A Measurement Model for Political Protest

Bayesian latent variable models hold great promise for estimating a variation in a number of political phenomena, including protest participation, that are only poorly measured over space and time.  These models maximize the information gleaned from all available surveys to overcome issues of missing and incomparable data; they also allow for an assessment of the surveys themselves.  This paper presents a quick overview of the method and some of the results obtained from its application to measuring political protest across countries and over time.
